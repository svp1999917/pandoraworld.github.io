		<p>Pandora World is a themed land located within Disney's 
			Animal Kingdom theme park in Florida. It is based on 
			the fictional world of Pandora from the movie Avatar, 
			and was created in collaboration with the film's director, 
			James Cameron. The land features stunning landscapes, 
			including floating mountains and bioluminescent forests, 
			as well as two major attractions: Avatar Flight of Passage 
			and Na'vi River Journey. Guests can also explore the Valley
			 of Mo'ara, interact with the local wildlife, and enjoy 
			 themed dining and shopping experiences. Pandora World 
			 is a must-visit for fans of the Avatar movie and anyone
			  looking to immerse themselves in a breathtakingly 
			  detailed and imaginative world</p>
